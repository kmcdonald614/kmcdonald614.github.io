        <div class="About Me" >
            <p>
                I like to golf, when I can (living in Minnesota means I am limited to do so from about May-September). When I am not golfing, I like to 
                go hangout with my friends, whether that is going to the bar for a few drinks, or going to a sporting event of some kind. My favorite 
                sport is basketball and I love going to Minnesota Timberwolves games.I love watching the marvel movies as well as Star Wars(the original
                3 and the prequels). I have 3 nephews, Maverick, Tristan, and Rhett ages 3,12,1 respectively. I love playing basketball and have aspirations
                of one day being able to dunk. One day I would like to Travel to Italy. I think it would be interesting to go to Rome. Also while I'm there,
                I would like to eat some pizza and gelato (yum!). Things people do not really now about me is that I like to be outdoors. Whether it's fishing,
                four-wheeling, or jet skiing, I enjoy being outside when I can be. I like meeting new people, so reach out and say hello!
