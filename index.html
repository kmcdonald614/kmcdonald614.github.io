         <div class="About-Me">
            <p>My name is Kevin McDonald and I am a senior at the University of St Thomas. I major in Computer Science and 
               am hoping to get a job specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I plan on going for my master's when I graduate 
               and receive my bachelors.I would like to take my graduate courses here at St.Thomas. If that is something that 
               would interest you, I would recommend looking at that <a href ="https://software.stthomas.edu/" target="_blank">here</a> 
               I'm not sure what lead me to aspire to become an Artificial Intelligence Engineer, but the idea of see AI in action, especially
               in something like robotics, seems fascinating to me. Maybe it's because I was a fan of the Terminator movies(the first two, that is).
                Something that I would like to make in the future would be something in robotics that could make my life easier, such as maybe making 
                a robot that could clean my house, it would make life that much easier.
