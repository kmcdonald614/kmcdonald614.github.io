        <p>I have not made a lot of projects on my own unfortunately but I had recently
            made a Web Sequence Diagram for my Senior Capstone class which is a project in
            itself. The purpose of this sequence diagram is to essentially map out a certain
            function in code and see where the corresponding method calls go to. For example,
            my sequence diagram had to do with the "add course" button in Spock. What happens behind
            the scene? It turns out, quite a bit! And then you have to create a diagram that represents
            the sequence of code that is executed with that certain action which is shown below.   
         </p>

            In my deep learning class I had an assignment where I was given a data set on the different species of Iris
            and I had to make 5 different networks to have the computer predict the Iris at a certain row in the dataset.
            First I had to Import the data into my .py file, then I had to convert all the categorical data in the dataset
            to numerical data. Once I manipulate the data to how I plan on having the computer learn, I start creating my networks.
            I had to create 5 different networks with different dense layers and dropout rates and layer activation functions to determine
            which network is the most accurate and can predict the Iris species of a certain row in the dataset. These networks are shown below.
            
        </p>

        Below is my results where I predict a species at a certain point in the dataset. I have a graph that shows the validation
        loss and the training loss. We want that graph to converge at the end like we see below. Then I display the predicted value at 
        position 0 and what the actual value is and we see that the numbers match. I only gave a high level representaion of what happens
        and there is much more to unpack. If you are interesting in learning how to create a network, click <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/step-by-step-guide-to-building-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-df64b1c5ab6e" target="_blank">here</a>

        One project I did that was not Computer Science related was an ethics paper. I wrote about different philosophies on which ethics
        was discussed and if people in today's society would classify as an ethical person. To much surprise, the results varied in numerous ways
        where people you may not have thought of as ethical, would have been considered ethical in one philospher's eye but not in another.
        Which ethical philosophy would be considered the most important to follow.
